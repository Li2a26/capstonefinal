    <div class="col-6"> <h3 class="grow up">Our story</h3> 
      <p>Our story is a celebration of love, diversity, and the vibrant tapestry of the LGBTQI+ community.
         We are more than just a store; we are a labor of love, a sanctuary of inclusivity, and a testament to the power of self-expression..</p>
         <p>Our journey began with a simple but profound idea: to create a space where every gender identity and sexual orientation is not just accepted but celebrated.
           Founded by LISA MBUWA, a proud member of the LGBTQI+ community, QUEER QUARTERS opened its doors to the world in 2023.</p>
